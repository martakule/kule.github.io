		<h2>Why Do Photo Research?</h2>

			<p>If you publish content, print or digital, you might at some point need photos to go with your text. Picking a theme picture for a blog post probably doesn’t feel much like research, but selecting illustrations for a college textbook can become quite a project. 
			</p>
			<p>Where I work, in educational publishing, we need photos for most of our college and university textbooks: large, visually appealing images for chapter openers, and smaller, more informative pictures to illustrate concepts throughout the text. The choice of the cover picture, though, we leave to graphic designers.
			</p>
			<p>For a textbook, the criteria of photo selection are narrowly defined. A chapter opener has to illustrate the general concept of the whole chapter, so it can’t be too specific but not too broad either. For example, what photo would you choose to open a chapter on gender in a sexuality textbook? Besides the content, the image also has to look good, being the first thing a reader will see, so ugly or blurry photos need not apply!
			</p>
			<p>If a textbook has 16 or 19 chapters, and each needs an opener and a bunch of smaller photos in the text, all meeting the strict criteria, that’s where the research begins.</p>

		<h2>Where to Get Your Photos?</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Some images in textbooks have to be obtained from specialized databases, like a portrait of a specific person for a history book or a cell cross-section for a biology text. However, for most textbook illustrations, website backgrounds, or blog post, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography" target="blank">stock photos</a> will do. What are stock photos? Basically images of objects and anonymous models depicting all kinds of life situations you might want to illustrate in your online or printed work. 
			</p>
			<p>There are some good free stock photo collections on the web, the most popular being <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="blank">Unsplash</a> — that’s where the picture in the background of this site comes from. This <a href="https://bootstrapbay.com/blog/free-stock-photos/" target="blank">article</a> from Bootstrap Bay lists the best destinations for spectacular free images to use in your desing. While Unsplash-type images are perfect for most websites, they are often too cool for a textbook. That’s where paid stock photos come in handy: from cheaper but lower quality, like Dreamstime or ThinkStock, to pricier but better, like Getty or Alamy. The logos below are links to the paid stock photo collections.</p>

		<h2>How Should the Photos Look?</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>High resolution is a given in print, and all of the stock photo websites do provide large images. For web, of course, it’s a balancing act between looking good and not loading too long. That involves different images for smaller screens, controlled by media queries, but that’s beyond photo research.
			</p>
			<p>In textbook publishing, we generally don’t like blurry photos, including Instagram-style filters and those dreamy pictures with sunlight flashes or glare on windows. Another thing you won’t have to worry about on the web but might in print is black-and-white photos. A lot of books are still published (or newsletters are photocopied) in one colour, so when you pick pictures for them, make sure that what looks super vibrant in full colour doesn’t turn into a grey blob in grayscale due to low contrast, like in the example below.

		<h2>What to Avoid?</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Depending on the purpose of your work, you might have to be careful about the content of the photos you select, in print or online. For example, if you’re a blogger for a health magazine and you wrote a post about the benefits of biking, you will probably illustrate it with people on bicycles. Now, your employer might request that the photo show cyclists in helmets so readers don’t get the wrong idea that the magazine promotes unsafe cycling. The same way, university and college textbooks don’t want to promote alcohol consumption among students, so for a photo of a celebration we wouldn’t go for people clinking glasses of champagne but rather shaking hands, hugging, or clapping. 
			</p>
			<p>Another big no-no for most pictures is looking fake. As you browse through stock photos, you’ll notice that so many of them look extremely staged and posed, with models either grinning regardless of circumstances or forcing unconvincing face expressions. A lot of stock photos will make you cringe. So the big challenge is to find those that look as if they were taken in a real-life situation.
			</p>
			<p>Let’s say you’re looking for a photo to show teamwork in an office environment. If it's for a textbook, it can't be <em>too</em> cool, so I'd have to wade through paid stock photo collections with gems such as <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/photo/their-plans-for-success-is-already-succeeding-gm501788288-81536515" target="blank">office workers laughing at self-adhesive notes</a> (I don't want to pay for them, so I'm just linking — go see for yourself), <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/photo/business-meeting-in-office-gm484163994-71091595" target="blank">businessmen pointing at turned off tablets</a>, or <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/photo/team-building-at-the-work-place-gm178608173-24909076" target="blank">colleagues doing an awkward mass high-five and staring into the camera</a>. I've discovered that the free stock photo collections actually have much better shots of people at work — looking focused (not grinning) and natural (not posed). However, they have a bias for the creative, designer crowd (people who took them, after all), so they're not the best source for illustrating a more conventional corporate environment.
			</p>
			<p>Anyway, there will always be some topics that the free collections cover and some that can use only paid stock photos. The two photos here are my top picks from the free collections for office teamwork. In fact, we recently selected the image with hands for a chapter opener in one of our books. I'm sure, though, that you could find something even better. Good luck, and have fun!
